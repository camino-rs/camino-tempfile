/// A named temporary file.
///
/// The default constructor, [`NamedUtf8TempFile::new()`], creates files in
/// the location returned by [`std::env::temp_dir()`], but `NamedUtf8TempFile`
/// can be configured to manage a temporary file in any location
/// by constructing with [`NamedUtf8TempFile::new_in()`].
///
/// # Security
///
/// Most operating systems employ temporary file cleaners to delete old
/// temporary files. Unfortunately these temporary file cleaners don't always
/// reliably _detect_ whether the temporary file is still being used.
///
/// Specifically, the following sequence of events can happen:
///
/// 1. A user creates a temporary file with `NamedUtf8TempFile::new()`.
/// 2. Time passes.
/// 3. The temporary file cleaner deletes (unlinks) the temporary file from the
///    filesystem.
/// 4. Some other program creates a new file to replace this deleted temporary
///    file.
/// 5. The user tries to re-open the temporary file (in the same program or in a
///    different program) by path. Unfortunately, they'll end up opening the
///    file created by the other program, not the original file.
///
/// ## Operating System Specific Concerns
///
/// The behavior of temporary files and temporary file cleaners differ by
/// operating system.
///
/// ### Windows
///
/// On Windows, open files _can't_ be deleted. This removes most of the concerns
/// around temporary file cleaners.
///
/// Furthermore, temporary files are, by default, created in per-user temporary
/// file directories so only an application running as the same user would be
/// able to interfere (which they could do anyways). However, an application
/// running as the same user can still _accidentally_ re-create deleted
/// temporary files if the number of random bytes in the temporary file name is
/// too small.
///
/// So, the only real concern on Windows is:
///
/// 1. Opening a named temporary file in a world-writable directory.
/// 2. Using the `into_temp_path()` and/or `into_parts()` APIs to close the file
///    handle without deleting the underlying file.
/// 3. Continuing to use the file by path.
///
/// ### UNIX
///
/// Unlike on Windows, UNIX (and UNIX like) systems allow open files to be
/// "unlinked" (deleted).
///
/// #### MacOS
///
/// Like on Windows, temporary files are created in per-user temporary file
/// directories by default so calling `NamedUtf8TempFile::new()` should be
/// relatively safe.
///
/// #### Linux
///
/// Unfortunately, most _Linux_ distributions don't create per-user temporary
/// file directories. Worse, systemd's tmpfiles daemon (a common temporary file
/// cleaner) will happily remove open temporary files if they haven't been
/// modified within the last 10 days.
///
/// # Resource Leaking
///
/// If the program exits before the `NamedUtf8TempFile` destructor is
/// run, the temporary file will not be deleted. This can happen
/// if the process exits using [`std::process::exit()`], a segfault occurs,
/// receiving an interrupt signal like `SIGINT` that is not handled, or by using
/// a statically declared `NamedUtf8TempFile` instance (like with `lazy_static`).
///
/// Use the [`tempfile()`] function unless you need a named file path.

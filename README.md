A secure, cross-platform, temporary file library for Rust with UTF-8 paths.

This crate is a wrapper around [`tempfile`](https://crates.io/crates/tempfile) that works with the `Utf8Path` and `Utf8PathBuf` types defined by [`camino`](https://crates.io/crates/camino). If your code mostly uses `camino`, it can be annoying to have to convert temporary paths to
`Utf8Path` over and over again. This crate manages that for you.

In addition to creating temporary files, this library also allows users to securely open multiple independent references to the same temporary file (useful for consumer/producer patterns and surprisingly difficult to implement securely).

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/camino-tempfile)

## Usage

Minimum required Rust version: 1.63.0

Add this to your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
camino-tempfile = "1"
```

## Example

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{Write, Read, Seek, SeekFrom};

fn main() {
    // Write
    let mut tmpfile: File = camino_tempfile::tempfile().unwrap();
    write!(tmpfile, "Hello World!").unwrap();

    // Seek to start
    tmpfile.seek(SeekFrom::Start(0)).unwrap();

    // Read
    let mut buf = String::new();
    tmpfile.read_to_string(&mut buf).unwrap();
    assert_eq!("Hello World!", buf);
}
```
